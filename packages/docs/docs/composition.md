id: composition
title: <Composition />
---

This is the component to use to register a video to make it renderable and make it show up in the sidebar of the Remotion Player.

## API

A `<Composition />` should be placed within a fragment of the root component (which is registered using [`registerRoot()`](/docs/register-root)).

The component takes the following props:

- `id`: ID of the composition, as shown in the sidebar and also a unique identifier of the composition that you need to specify if you want to render it. The ID can only contain letters, numbers and `-`.

- `fps`: At how many frames the composition should be rendered.

- `durationInFrames`: How many frames the composition should be long.

- `height`: Height of the composition in pixels.

- `width`: Width of the composition in pixels.

- `component` **or** `lazyComponent`: Pass the component in directly **or** pass a function that returns a dynamic import. Passing neither or both of the props is an error.

:::tip
If you use `lazyComponent`, Remotion will use React Suspense to load the component. Components will be compiled by Webpack as they are needed, which will reduce startup time of Remotion.
:::

:::info
If you use `lazyComponent`, you need to use a default export for your component. This is a restriction of React Suspense.
:::

- `defaultProps` _optional_: Give your component default props that will be shown in the preview. You can override these props during render using a CLI flag.

:::tip
Type your components using the `React.FC<{}>` type and the `defaultProps` prop will be typesafe.

## Example using `component`

```tsx twoslash
// @allowUmdGlobalAccess
// @filename: ./MyComp.tsx
export const MyComp = () => <></>;

// @filename: index.tsx
// ---cut---
import { Composition } from "remotion";
import { MyComp } from "./MyComp";

export const MyVideo = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Composition
        id="my-comp"
        component={MyComp}
        width={1080}
        height={1080}
        fps={30}
        durationInFrames={3 * 30}
      />
    </>
  );
};
```

## Example using `lazyComponent`

```tsx
export const MyVideo = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Composition
        id="my-comp"
        lazyComponent={() => import("./LazyComponent")}
        width={1080}
        height={1080}
        fps={30}
        durationInFrames={3 * 30}
      />
    </>
  );
};
```
