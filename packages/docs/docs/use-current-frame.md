With this hook, you can retrieve the current frame of the video. Frames are 0-indexed, meaning the first frame is `0`, the last frame is the duration of the composition in frames minus one. To learn more about how Remotion works with time, read the page about [the fundamentals](/docs/the-fundamentals).

If the component you are writing is wrapped in a `<Sequence>`, `useCurrentFrame` will return the frame relative to when the Sequence starts.

Say the timeline marker is positioned at frame 25. In the example below, `useCurrentFrame` will return `25`, except within the Subtitle component, where it will return `15` because it is within a sequence that starts at frame 10.

```tsx twoslash
import { Sequence, useCurrentFrame } from "remotion";

const Title = () => {
  const frame = useCurrentFrame(); // 25
  return <div>{frame}</div>;
};

const Subtitle = () => {
  const frame = useCurrentFrame(); // 15
  return <div>{frame}</div>;
};

const MyVideo = () => {
  const frame = useCurrentFrame(); // 25

  return (
    <div>
      <Title />
      <Sequence from={10}>
        <Subtitle />
      </Sequence>
    </div>
  );
};
```
